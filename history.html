The Kenwood Drive-in was a Louisville favorite since the summer of 1949. On June 24th of that year, it became the city's sixth open air theater. The first picture showed at the theater was a single feature: Command Decision starring Clark Gable, Walter Pidgeon, Van Johnson, and Brian Donlevy.<br>According to vintage newspaper ads, the Kenwood may have been a sister theater to the Parkway drive-in (formerly located on Millers Lane at Cane Run Road) and the New Albany drive-in of Indiana (also closed). <br>Radio advertisements could be heard for the Kenwood on the classic Louisvile station WAKY 790AM during the 1960's. These commercials often told of b-movie horror marathons that were popular drive-in fare of the day. Sadly, the theater closed in 2008, just one year shy of its 60th anniversary. The final double feature was played labor day weekend, showing Disaster Movie and Tropic Thunder. The family favorite and city landmark will be greatly missed.   </p>
